# SmartLab: Full Stack Web App

This is a full stack web application built with React, TypeScript and Postgres, styled with tailwind. This was motivated from the final project of the Complete Web Developer course offered by [Zero To Mastery Academy](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/coding-bootcamp/). Designed using Figma.
